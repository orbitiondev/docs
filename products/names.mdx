Orbition Names is a decentralized naming system built on the Orbition network. It provides human-readable names to blockchain addresses, smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps), similar to domain names on the internet. Orbition Names make it easier for users to interact with the Orbition network by replacing complex addresses with simple and memorable names. Orbition Names is accessible [here](https://names.orbition.network)

## Components of Orbition Names

1. **Smart Contracts:** Orbition Names uses a set of smart contracts deployed on the Orbition blockchain. These contracts manage the registration, resolution, and management of names.

2. **Subgraph:** The Orbition Names subgraph is a tool used to index and query data from the Orbition blockchain related to names and their associated addresses. It provides a convenient way for frontend applications to access name data.

3. **Node:** Nodes on the Orbition network play a crucial role in the resolution of Orbition Names. They receive and process queries for name resolution, ensuring that the correct address is returned for a given name.

4. **Frontend:** The frontend of Orbition Names refers to the user interface that interacts with the smart contracts and subgraph. It allows users to register and manage names, as well as resolve names to addresses.

## How Orbition Names Works

1. **Registration:** Users can register a name through the Orbition Names frontend by interacting with the smart contracts. The registration process involves selecting a name and linking it to a blockchain address or resource.

2. **Resolution:** When someone wants to interact with a registered name, the Orbition Names frontend queries the subgraph or node to resolve the name to its associated address. This allows users to send transactions to human-readable names.

3. **Management:** Name owners can manage their names through the Orbition Names frontend. They can update the associated address, set up subdomains, and transfer ownership of the name.

## Benefits of Orbition Names

- **User-Friendly:** Orbition Names provides human-readable names that are easier to remember and share than complex blockchain addresses.
- **Decentralized:** Orbition Names is built on the Orbition network, ensuring decentralization and censorship resistance.
- **Interoperability:** Orbition Names can be used across different applications and services on the Orbition network, making it easier to interact with decentralized services.

In conclusion, Orbition Names is a critical component of the Orbition network, providing a user-friendly and decentralized naming system for blockchain addresses and resources.
