In this section we will tell how you can get free testnet OBNs on Orbition Testnet for testing / building dApps:

<CardGroup>

  <Card title="Native OBN" icon="terminal" href="#airdrop-on-native-chain">
   Native currency of Orbition Native chain
  </Card>

  <Card title="EVM OBN" icon="link" href="#airdrop-on-orbition-network-evm-testnet">
   Native currency of EVM layer of Orbition Network
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## Prerequisites
<CardGroup cols={1}>

  <Card title="Command Line Interface" icon="terminal" href="/quickstart">
   Orbition CLI should be installed for claiming tokens on Native Chain
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

## Airdrop on Native Chain
To claim free testnet tokens on Orbition Network Testnet Native chain

Set Orbition Network Testnet RPC url in the Orbition config
```bash
orbition config set --url https:/rpc-testnet.orbition.network
```

```bash
orbition airdrop 10
```

You can also bridge these tokens to EVM Testnet

```bash
orbition evm transfer-to-evm 0xf50860558A66C7cF0C5bbE44C8f2683A48C22189 10
```

## Airdrop on Orbition Network EVM (Testnet)
You can not airdrop EVM tokens directly from Orbition CLI but you can bridge them by requesting them on [Native Chain](#airdrop-on-native-chain)

You can use [Testnet Faucet UI](https://faucet.orbition.network) for claiming Testnet tokens by entering your EVM Address
