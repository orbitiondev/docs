  </Card>

  <Card title="EVM Transactions" icon="link" href="#sending-tokens-to-evm-address">

## Sending tokens to Native Address
To send transaction to any native address you need address of recipient and the amount to transfer.

```bash
$ orbition transfer
error: The following required arguments were not provided:
    <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS>
    <AMOUNT>

USAGE:
    orbition transfer <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> --config <FILEPATH>

For more information try --help
```

For example: Sending `10 OBNs` to `Agw3GE5zZVCWk5RYTm1aGSpuitiiCF3zXLS3gazybZMK`

```bash
orbition transfer Agw3GE5zZVCWk5RYTm1aGSpuitiiCF3zXLS3gazybZMK 10
```

If the recipient doesn't have any tokens, then you will need to pass an additional flag with the above command, like this 

```bash
orbition transfer Agw3GE5zZVCWk5RYTm1aGSpuitiiCF3zXLS3gazybZMK 10 --allow-unfunded-recipient
```

## Sending tokens to EVM Address
To send transaction to any evm address you need address of recipient and the amount to transfer.

For example: Sending `10 OBNs` to `0xf50860558A66C7cF0C5bbE44C8f2683A48C22189`

```bash
orbition evm transfer-to-evm 0xf50860558A66C7cF0C5bbE44C8f2683A48C22189 10
```
