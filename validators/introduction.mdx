A validator is a computer that helps to run the Orbition Network. Each validator executes a program that keeps track of all accounts on the Orbition Network cluster and validates transactions being added to the network. Without validators, Orbition would not be able to function.

The more independent entities that run validators, the less vulnerable the cluster is to an attack or catastrophe that affects the cluster.

By becoming a validator, you are helping to grow the network. You are also learning firsthand how the Orbition cluster functions at the lowest level. You will become part of an active community of operators that are passionate about the Orbition ecosystem.

## Earning Opportunities

Validators are rewarded for their work in maintaining the network. By validating transactions and securing the network, you can earn rewards in the form of OBN tokens. The rewards are distributed based on the amount of work your validator contributes to the network. The more you participate, the more you can earn. Additionally, validators can earn transaction fees from the transactions they validate.
